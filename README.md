# SANEM

## Introduction

SANEM is a product developed as a toy simulation of energy grid dynamics.

It generates some grids given properties of connection and vulnerability as well as the data of demand and production offer. In addition, the product simulation cut-down issues which make some of the consumers without any energy source and SANEM 

## Utilities of the tool

    - Simulate Consumer/Producer system with critical shortage of energy.
    
    - Cascading issue simulation on grid systems.

    - Root cause as node source of critical issues on grids.
        Given some data, simulated or real, you can detect the root cause of each critical issue
    
    - Classification of critical issues.
